# SWARM-DMAS-wrench

**SWARM-DMAS-wrench** is a simulation framework built on top of WRENCH for evaluating decentralized meta-scheduling algorithms in distributed computing environments.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- WRENCH installed and configured
- CMake ≥ 3.10
- Boost libraries

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frs69wq/SWARM-DMAS-wrench.git
cd SWARM-DMAS-wrench
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
cd ..
```

## 🚀 Running the Simulation

To run the simulation:

```bash
cd build
./swarm_dmas experiments/scenario.json
```
A JSOn file describing an experimental scenario is structured as follows:

```json
{
    "workload": "workloads/heterogeneous_mix_10.json",
    "platform": "platforms/AmSC.xml",
    "policy": "PythonBidding",
    "bidder": "python_scripts/random_bidder.py",
    "hearbeat_period": 5,
    "heartbeat_expiration": 15,
    "hardware_failure_profile": "hardware_failure_profiles/test.json"
}
```

## 🧠 Agent Roles (in src/agents/)
Each agent extends WRENCH's simulation API to implement custom behaviors.

TBD


## 📊 Policy Roles (in src/policies/)
Policies define the decision-making logic used by the meta-scheduler or local schedulers.

 - PureLocal: Jobs are scheduled only on the system where they were submitted (baseline).
 - RandomBidding: Jobs are randomly assigned to another system.
 - HeuristicBidding:
 - PythonBidding:
    - ``llm_claude_bidder.py``
