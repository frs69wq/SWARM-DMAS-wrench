## TODO
- [x] Decide how to enforce local execution when we don't want to use the network of JSAs
  - [ ] Option 1: use the 'can_forward' member of a JobRequestMessage
  - [x] Option 2: implement a default behavior for a JSA that consists in directly submitting the job to the local HPC system. 
- [ ] Implement a flexible workflow in JobSchedulingAgent::processEventCustom
  - [ ] Have steps 1 to 3 below as separate functions
    - [x] Define a SchedulingPolicy abstract class that requires the following 3 steps.
      - [ ] Define child classes that implement a specific policy
        - [x] Option 1: A default policy that does not rely on the agent network would have no-op functions for steps 1 to 3 and just perform step 4 directly
        - [ ] Option 2: Step 2 can use either heuristic- or LLM-based bidding leading to different policies
    - [ ] Assign the scheduling policy to JSAs at the beginning of the simulation.
      - [ ] add command line argument giving the name of a scheduling policy
      - [ ] parse this command line argument to create the corresponding object
  - [ ] Step 1: Broadcast the jobDescription to the network of JSAs
      - [x] test the value of can_forward_ to determine if the job is an original submission from the WSA or a forward from a JSA
      - [ ] if true then broadcast the JobDescription to the other agents (with can_forward set to false)
      - [ ] if false
        - [x] Option 1: Move to step 2
        - [ ] Option 2 (resilient): Send ack to sender (has code modification implications)
          - [ ] this includes adding a step to wait for the acks and handle agents not responding (timeout)
  - [ ] Step 2: Retrieve the current status of the locally managed HPC System
  - [ ] Step 3: Compute my own bid for the job
      - [x] Option 1: Do nothing
      - [ ] Option 2: Use a heuristic, based on JobDescription, HPCSystem Description, and current system state
      - [ ] Option 3: Call a LLM
  - [ ] Step 4: Find a consensus on the winner of the competitive bidding for that job
      - [x] Option 1: Do nothing
      - [ ] Option 2: Send bid to all other JSAs, then decide of winner locally based on all values
        - [ ] Manage tie breaking
      - [ ] Option 3: ???
  - [x] Step 4: Upon winning the competitive bidding, schedule the job on my local HPC system
- [x] Create an HPCSystem Class that contains a static high level description of the system
  - [x] Decide of the information to have
    - [x] name: string
    - [ ] type: enum whose values are HPC, AI, GPU, HYBRID, MEMORY, STORAGE
    - [x] num_nodes: size_t
    - [x] has_gpu: bool
    - [ ] memory_amount_in_gb: int
    - [ ] storage_amount_in_gb: int
    - [ ] network_interconnect: string 
  - [ ] Add missing information to the platform description 
  - [x] Create the .h file
  - [ ] Instantiate at parsing time
  - [x] Pass it to the JSA at creation time

## FIXME
- [ ] Decide whether job completion notifications are sent to the WSA (current) or handled locally by the JSAs. This impacts most of the code with the "originator" thing
- [X] Directly pass the JobDescription in a JobRequestMessage and only parse/transform when needed to submit job locally
- [X] Use a proper ctor to fill the job description
- [ ] Use a proper ctor to fill the HPC system description
- [X] @Prachi: Change `user_id` and `group_id` from `string` to `int` in the workload generator (hence removing `user_`, `group_` and the quotes in the values)
