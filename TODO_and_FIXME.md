## TODO
- [x] Decide how to enforce local execution when we don't want to use the network of JSAs
  - [ ] ~~Option 1: use the 'can_forward' member of a JobRequestMessage~~
  - [x] Option 2: implement a default behavior for a JSA that consists in directly submitting the job to the local HPC system. 
- [ ] Implement a flexible workflow in JobSchedulingAgent::processEventCustom
  - [ ] Have steps 1 to 3 below as separate functions
    - [x] Define a SchedulingPolicy abstract class that requires the following 3 steps.
      - [ ] Define child classes that implement a specific policy
        - [x] Option 1: A default policy that does not rely on the agent network would have no-op functions for steps 1 to 3 and just perform step 4 directly
        - [ ] Option 2: Step 2 can use either heuristic- or LLM-based bidding leading to different policies
    - [x] Assign the scheduling policy to JSAs at the beginning of the simulation.
      - [x] add command line argument giving the name of a scheduling policy
      - [x] parse this command line argument to create the corresponding object
  - [ ] Step 1: Broadcast the jobDescription to the network of JSAs
      - [x] test the value of can_forward_ to determine if the job is an original submission from the WSA or a forward from a JSA
      - [x] if true then broadcast the JobDescription to the other agents but myself (with can_forward set to false)
      - [ ] if false
        - [x] PureLocal: Move to step 2
        - [ ] Option 2 (resilient): Send ack to sender (has code modification implications)
          - [ ] this includes adding a step to wait for the acks and handle agents not responding (timeout)
  - [ ] Step 2: Retrieve the current status of the locally managed HPC System
  - [ ] Step 3: Compute my own bid for the job
      - [x] PureLocal: Do nothing
      - [ ] Option 2: Use a heuristic, based on JobDescription, HPCSystem Description, and current system state
      - [ ] Option 3: Call a LLM
      - [x] Store the local bid for the job
        - [ ] Decide if we clean up when a job is completed or keep all bids for explanability
  - [x] Step 4: Broadcast my bid to other agents
      - [x] Create a BidOnJob message
      - [x] Broadcast it
        - [x] PureLocal: just send it to myself
        - [x] Option 2: send it to all other agents (including myself)
      - [x] Process this new type of message in Step 5
  - [ ] Step 5: Find a consensus on the winner of the competitive bidding for that job
      - [x] Need to know how many bids are expected to take a decision
        - [x] PureLocal: set to 1
        - [x] Option 2: set to the size of the agent network
      - [ ] When all the expected bids have been received, take a decision
        - [x] PureLocal: Do nothing, return true
        - [ ] Option 2: Compare local bid to all other bids
          - [ ] Manage tie breaking
        - [ ] Option 3: ???
  - [x] Step 4: Upon winning the competitive bidding, schedule the job on my local HPC system
- [x] Create an HPCSystem Class that contains a static high level description of the system
  - [x] Decide of the information to have
    - [x] name: string
    - [x] type: enum whose values are HPC, AI, GPU, HYBRID, MEMORY, STORAGE
      - Aurora: AI, Crux: STORAGE, Perlmutter: HYBRID, Frontier: HPC, Andes: STORAGE
      - We have no MEMORY or GPU systems
        - [ ] Frontier has much more memory than other. Add a second category?
        - [ ] GPU is redundant with `has_gpu`. Remove it?
    - [x] num_nodes: size_t
    - [x] has_gpu: bool
    - [x] memory_amount_in_gb: int
    - [x] storage_amount_in_gb: double
    - [x] network_interconnect: string
  - [x] Add missing information to the platform description
  - [x] Create the .h file
  - [x] Instantiate at parsing time
  - [x] Pass it to the JSA at creation time

## FIXME
- [ ] Decide whether job completion notifications are sent to the WSA (current) or handled locally by the JSAs. This impacts most of the code with the "originator" thing
- [x] Directly pass the JobDescription in a JobRequestMessage and only parse/transform when needed to submit job locally
- [x] Use a proper ctor to fill the job description
- [x] Use a proper ctor to fill the HPC system description
- [ ] Refactor: create SchedulingPolicy with the network of agents as a member.
- [x] @Prachi: Change `user_id` and `group_id` from `string` to `int` in the workload generator (hence removing `user_`, `group_` and the quotes in the values)
